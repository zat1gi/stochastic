commit f847914084c4d5a55ca784f1841c5a9383289de5
Author: Aaron Olson <zat1gi@yahoo.com>
Date:   Sat Oct 18 11:49:32 2014 -0600

    Progress: Leakage pdfs, I have added the plotting function.  Things to address soon: 1) The plots are not normalized correctly: you should not have probabilities of 10.  2) I don't think there is any checking of whether the method was run/whether you want to plot the pdf of the leakage results.  It may be nice to give these a checking function in the input checking subroutine.  3) Running all methods functions just fine, but running only the atomic mix functions segfaults in 'MCLeakage_pdfbinprint'.  Fix this and ensure other combinations do not segfault.

    Progress: Leakage pdf progress, uncommented old pdf plotter, integrated it in 'UQ_MC', added new methods.  This subroutine no longer plots, but still bins and prints the data.  Next comes the plotter.

    Sidebar: Created 'Eigenvalue', a function to solve for values of eigenvalues.  Currently there are three times I solve this, common coding is good.  Although now that I have taken variance out of the eigenvalue solve I can probably reduce this to one instance.

Author: Aaron Olson <aaronjeffreyolson@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 16 14:48:58 2014 -0600

    Progress: Finished pulling the Co term out right.  Actually, since there is 'sqrt(Eig)' in the denominator of the xi values, you don't need one in front of the summation.  You can pull anything out you want without affecting the reconstructions, since the eigenvalue cancels itself out anyway.

    Sidebar: Added 'compare.sh'.  It is a bash script which will run the currenty copy of the code side-by-side with the same code which is located at '../stochastic2/stochastic' relative to this copy.  For outputs to compare, include the string 'flag' in print statements.  This is to be used for side-by-side debugging.

Date:   Tue Oct 14 16:30:53 2014 -0600

    Tried to make Co pulling out work.  Not there yet.  Variance of reconstructed cross sections always greatly reduces, which should not happen.  If and when I figure it out, it would be nice to get rid of this commit.  I really should learn to stash.

    Sidebar: moved 'Coscat' and 'Coabs' to be 'genRealzvars' like they should be.  Created 'sigscatave' and 'sigabsave' as 'genRealzvars', and precomputed them.  Results are as before this commit, with an error in the way I pulled out 'Co' and 'lamc' remaining.

    I think new xi gen scheme implemented correctly.  But I have found that I did not remove Co and lamc from their places correctly.  My work with that mainained the mean, but reduced the effective variance so much that the problem is nearly atomic mix.  Must fix that, then finish verifying this.

    'Save commit', not verified at all.  I have added 'KLWood_actscatrat' function, expanded 'KLrxi_point2' function which the previous calls, added precomputing of 'Coscat' and 'Coabs'.  I need to run verification tests on all of this work, and consider precomputing the average scattering xs and average absorption xs now used in 'KLrxi_point2'.

Author: Aaron Olson <aaronjeffreyolson@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 7 15:27:54 2014 -0600

    Added new variables in 'variables'.  Used flag to implement different generations of xi from common coding depending on input.  Old method still produces same results, new method runs, and should get correct results after implementing rest of method.

Author: Aaron Olson <aaronjeffreyolson@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 7 15:05:55 2014 -0600

    Added flag 'KLxigentype' with values of either 'totxs' or 'material' to differentiat old implementation and new implementation here.  Also modified and verified test in 'testinputstoc' to allow dissimilar cross sections when in 'material' mode, but not 'totxs' mode.

    Added comments for upcoming addition of the new material centric xi distributions, which will allow noncongruent input scattering ratios for the two materials in a binary Markov case.  I updated the comments for KL_collect, and commented where changes will be made.  Specifically with that: 'KLresearch', 'KL_collect' update this sub, 'radtransMC' 'MCtransport' use new function for evaluation of scattering ratio and add new function 'KLWood_actscatrat' to module, 'variables' 'KLvars' add 'Coscat' and 'Coabs', 'Loadcase' 'testinputstoc' allow dissimilar scattering ratios.

Date:   Tue Oct 7 12:31:22 2014 -0600

    Made actual 6 changes (plus 'use'ing variables) to pull 'CoExp' and 'lamc' out of Eigenvalues.  Previous commit flags where changes are to be made, they are actually made here.  Transport values seem as expected.  In reactor like case here, LP and atomic mix actually do very well, although you can see convergence upon correct values going from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 eigenvalues using this method.

Author: Aaron Olson <aaronjeffreyolson@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 7 12:19:04 2014 -0600

    Notes made for separating 'Co' and 'lamc' from eigenvalues.  Expect three changes in 'KLresearch' when creating Eigenvalue values, 2 in 'KLmeanadjust' when using them (one evaluating at a point, one evaluating an integral), and 1 in 'radtransMC' when evaluating at a point, duplicate function of one in 'KLmeanadjust', someday should make only one.  Also fixed a spelling error in a comment and added to 'codingnotes'.

    Fixed 'radWood' error.  Was introduced between d24a9ef and f2fdf08, when I added 'newpos'.  In the collision evaluation I was still using 'position', but needed to now use 'newpos', since 'position' is now updated later.  This explains why 'radWood' has had incorrect results since those commits.

    'radWood' fixed.  From 97afa26.  Disregard last 4 commits.  Error introduced between d24a9ef and f2fdf08.  I there added 'newpos', delaying the actual stepping of 'position', but was still using 'position' in the collision evalutation.

    Cannot find scenario in which 'KLWood' gives strange flux profile behavior without negatives in material reconstructions, suggesting what I saw before was due to this effect only, which is not a coding error, but simply telling of the shortcomings of such negativities.

    Yay!  I think I have debugged the flux issue!  Need more verification, and to get rid of old comments, etc., but I think I got it!  I was evaluating the scattering operation before collecting the flux... so new 'mu's were assigned for old, about-to-be tallied tracklengths!  :)

    Got rid of some dependencies on 'Woodcock' and 'KLmeanadjust' so that I could compile after a 'make clean'.  Also implemented a test against an old algorithm for flux tallies and plots.  'MCfluxtally', 'stocMC_stats', the printer, and the plotter match up, at least as far as the test.  Where is this bug?????

    Added subroutine that prints values of flux.  Did some debugging in 'MCfluxtally', including adding a flag and a subroutine for it.  I think I will need to debug more, at least with 'radMC' method (currently working with 'radWood' method).  Also will need to debug in 'stocMC_stats', simply compile and run with current input to see this.

Author: Aaron Olson <aaronjeffreyolson@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 16 14:57:29 2014 -0600

    Added 'MCprecalc_fluxmatnorm', which for 'radMC' and 'radWood' tallies the material per cell flux nnormalization, and 'MCLPprecalc_fluxmatnorm', which does the same thing on the fly for 'LPMC'.  Each of these normalizations still need to be normalized... but that will come in the stats.  These tally how much of each material is in each bin, which is the raw data needed for the normalization to occur.  Next will be to actually code the normalization.

    Added 'MCfluxtallywrapper', and now routing all flux tallies through it.  It breaks down tracklengths for 'radWood' into single material pieces for tallying, and gives a value for 'i' to pass for every method, many of which simply get a dummy argument.  It compiles, though I have not tested running.  I still need to normalize, plot, and verify.

    Input testing improvements.  Specifically 'stopstatus' changed to 'flstopstatus', 'flsleep' added to accomodate switching on 'KLres' or 'KLrec' when dependent functions are on but either is off, along with comment, re-asserting 'KLrnumRealz' to be the same as 'numRealz', but only when 'KLWood' is on, and asserting that scattering ratios must be the same within chosen tolerance when 'KLWood' is on.

    Not verified, but the code runs here.  Need to add time printing, and stats, then verify against old versions of the code and published benchmarks, but the code at least runs here.

    Not a functioning commit.  Just done a lot and want a chance to save!  Working on 'UQ_MC' and 'MCtransport', nearly done with first good commit for them.

    Not a functioning commitgit add --all .!  This commit is midstream of creating 'MCtransport', and the code will not run at this commit!  I am in the middle of merging logic, and allocating/initiating in the allocation subroutine.  I should continue here before I lose sight on what I am doing!

    Collected and simplified KL reconstruction functions.  I also did a little other cleaning up here and there.  All the reorganizing in the main is done save transport, which is a non-negligable task.

    KL operations isolated before transport.  This is actually a pretty large commit, but these things had to be done together.  The main thing is that I have taken all 'KL research' things (or almost all) and put them in a block before any transport.  I had to create realizations on the fly to do this.  In the future I plan to have the option to use the same realizations or create new ones for transport, but for now they will be different.  I need to figure out what to do with plotting from these realizations... maybe a flag to say which set of realizations to print from, the family over which KL is performed, the family over which radMC is performed, the family over which radWood is performed, etc.

    A few more basic changes to the main, and decided to leave 'j' as a pass by reference, at least for now. ('j' is current realization)  Maybe it would be best to make this 'curReal' or something like that and stick it in 'genRealzvars'... but for now it remains pass by reference.

    'numEigs' and 'tnumEigs' to modular form.  'tnumEigs' only used once, would like to not have it a global variable, but it is passed by reference to a function that numEigs is passed to.  I would need to actually pass 'numEigs' to that function by reference to get around this.  Maybe worth a change later, but not now.

    Get Rid of ANS2014 Files
    
    Directory ANS2014, containing data used when writing the winter paper,
    has been moved to be with the paper and out of my code!  That is all.

    ANS2014 Changes Only
    
    I created a new .gnu file in ASN2014, but changed nothing in the actual
    code.  It may be better if I save all of this with the actual paper and
    get it out of my research code.  I will probably do that later.  This
    commit is essentially only to save this new .gnu file and its output and
    does not affect the actual code at all.

    This is my first real commit to github with my PhD research code.
    This is immediately after submitting the first paper to ANS.
    Recently I began a re-structure of variables to their own modules, and better grouping of subroutines and functions.
    I plan for my next work to be finishing this task that I have started.
    It will make loading variables where I want them much easier, requiring loading from modules, not passing by reference every single time.
