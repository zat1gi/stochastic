-things I could improve... worth it??
	-stunted functionality
		-plots of pdfs, need this one!!
		-combine radtrans_int and Wood_rej, into one global variable and use data
		-deal with genRealz printing/plotting only in first call

	-efficiency
		-make ‘dx’ a global variable?
		-take a look at bins for ceiling determination for Woodcock sampling

	-better code practice
		-set each func/sub to only load when actually needed
		-get rid of dual functions KLrxi_point(2)
		-'!consider using internal_init_i' in several places
		-in 'MCfluxtallywrapper' standardize ‘radWood’ loop which doesn’t use flag method
		-in 'MCfluxPrint' consider removing these plots somewhere else, like 'clearreports'
		-consolidate 'KLmeanadjust.f90' into 'KLreconstruct.f90'
		-maybe remove in-module global variable style from 'KLmeanadjust.f90'
