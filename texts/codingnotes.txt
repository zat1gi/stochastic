-things I could improve... worth it??
	-plots of pdfs, need this one!!
	-'!consider using internal_init_i' in several places
	-interaction tallies, do something with them?
	-make ‘dx’ a global variable?
	-combine radtrans_int and Wood_rej, which tally interactions, into one global variable
	-in 'MCfluxtallywrapper' standardize ‘radWood’ loop which doesn’t use flag method
	-deal with genRealz printing/plotting only in first call
	-take a look at bins for ceiling determination for Woodcock sampling
	-in 'MCfluxPrint' consider removing these plots somewhere else, like 'clearreports'
